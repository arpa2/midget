TODO for Midget
===============

This was a useful idea for a utility that came up when I was getting to
learn to use Python's imaplab.  The learning path is somewhat visible in
the current code, which could therefore use a bit of a cleanup.

I suppose I will leave it like this, until I feel confident with imaplib
and don't mind erasing the history to... well, the historic traces in git.

What should still be done, is locating the IMAP server by way of SRV
records, based on Kerberos-to-DNS changes.  For now, set the remote_hostname
in the script to your local IMAP server address.
